cozy-youth-theme
=======
A light cozy ghost blog theme for developers. 

The following may or may not be features you desire, but they are what I like about this theme.

Features:
* Lists blogs on the front page. No splash screen.
* Crisp font
* Side bar showing latest 10 posts
* Side bar showing pages you make, such as 'about me'
* Interesting textured background
* Syntax highlighting for code
* Sweet RSS pop-up
* Some share buttons on post pages
* Mobile friendly
